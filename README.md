You can override/modify this yourself (plus anything else you desire) in a "user.css" file within
the /administrator/templates/atum/css/ folder.
An example modified user.css with reduced sidebar width and sevral other more subtle typography
changes can be found at https://github.com/TheStyleGuyzTeam/J4Atum-user-css
